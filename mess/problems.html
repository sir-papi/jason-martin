        <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
        <p>Here is some introductory text about myself. I am sleepy. Fresh off of 3 ski slopes in the last 36 hours. 
            Its been a blast, exhausting, physically draining, my body feels some of the aftermath.
            But i wish i: could go tomorrow; could own a property in the Poconos; could üèÇ daily. Its my happy place.
            And i plan, <b>schemin!</b> to activate this practically into my flow of wellness & mindfulness. To make it my practice.
            Deliberately... For now, however, i am on this problem set. But there are no problems (R.Ackoff). Only messes!
            And i am currently working on systems; based on the work of <a href="https://thesystemsthinker.com/a-lifetime-of-systems-thinking/">Ackoff</a>, 
            Senge, Meadows, and others. I am learning to think <a href="https://medium.com/disruptive-design/tools-for-systems-thinkers-the-6-fundamental-concepts-of-systems-thinking-379cdac3dc6a">systemically</a>,
            I am learning to see the world as a system of systems. To see the interconnections, the feedback loops, the delays, and the unintended consequences.
