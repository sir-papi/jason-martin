/* 
The ::after pseudo-element creates an element that is the last child of the selected element. 
You can use it to add an empty element after the last image. 
If you give it the same width as the images it will push the last image to the left
when the gallery is in a two-column layout. 
Right now, it is in the center because you set justify-content: center on the flex container.
Notice how the blue image border extends beyond the red gallery border. 
This is due to the way browsers calculate the size of container elements.

The box-sizing property is used to set this behavior. 
By default, the content-box model is used. With this model, 
when an element has a specific width, 
that width is calculated based only on the element's content. 
Padding and border values get added to the total width, 
so the element grows to accommodate these values.

Try setting box-sizing to content-box explicitly, 
with the global * selector. 
At this point, you will not see any changes, 
because you are using the default value.
*/
/*
The border-box sizing model does the opposite of content-box. 
The total width of the element, including padding and border, 
will be the explicit width set. 
The content of the element will shrink to make room for the padding and border.

Change the box-sizing property to border-box. 
Notice how your blue image borders now fit within your red gallery border.
