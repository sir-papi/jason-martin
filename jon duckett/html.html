        <h1>Main Heading</h1>
        <p>this is a paragraph but the text could be the introduction to a page. 
            A paragraph consists of one or more sentences that form a self-contained unit of discourse. 
            The start of a paragraph is indicated by a new line.</p>
        <p>Text is easier to understand when it is split up into units of text.
            For this reason we could include intentional line breaks.<br />
            in the middle of a paragraph.<br />
            And we could also include a horizontal rule to separate sections of text.<hr />
            I could make words <b>bold</b> or <i>italic</i> or <u>underlined</u>. 
            And if the page is long it could be split into several subheadings.
        </p>
        <h2>Subheading</h2>
        <p>Subheadings are used to split up the text into sections. 
            This makes the text easier to read and understand. 
            The subheadings could be used to describe the content that follows.
            We can use the <strong>strong</strong> element to also make text bold for emphasis.
            or we can add <em>emphasis</em> with that element.
            And because its Ramadaan we need H<sub>2</sub>O on this Monday the 10<sup>th</sup> of March 2025.
