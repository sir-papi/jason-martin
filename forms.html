            <p><b>This is your standard T+C agreement:</b></p>
            <p>It contains a whole lotta shit that we really should read (me included) yet we (well speaking for myself, <b>I</b> most likely will not.<br>
            Damn shame but thats just the reality of the situation.<br><br>We are gonna put it here anyway & blah blah blah somethin somethin somethin. <br>
            They say it never come to fruition unless the vision is crafted
            My drive is relentlessly, repetitiously mastered<br>
            Progress is positive, pessimism is backward<br>
            Since failure ain't attractive my next decision was drastic<br>
            I made it out of pit falls strictly due to my passion<br>
            Supreme intellect, not to mention wisdom to match it<br>
            Name another n***a that put up 50 in practice<br>
            Dis shit is magic, even my exhibition is classic<br>
            Funny I ain't end up broke, like you predicted<br>
            There's a thousand n***as like you no need to be too specific<br>
            I outmaneuver goofies like you would a few decisions<br>
            When the proof is missing you get reduced to a euphemism<br>
            Shit the truth is wicked<br>
            I just threw a surprise party, at a see-through mansion<br>
            My n***a, I'm stupid gifted<br>
            This voodoo mixed with, clear struggle and shear hustle<br>
            I'm trying to stretch ham-string me too long and I tear a muscle<br>
            N***a where was you, when we was down and we slaved in kitchens<br>
            With my homie putting cut on that bird like it's Cajun chicken<br>
            I'm amazing, they parade but my crown wasn't made to fit 'em<br>
            You got signed off my signature style, that's plagiarism<br>
            I'm Miagi with it<br>
            Try to kick it like I can kick it?<br>
            You just begging to get buried alive<br>
            But I can dig it</p>
