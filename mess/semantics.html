            <p>Que reflejan tu mirada
                La noche, t√∫ y yo
                I got this fire burnin' in me from within
                Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin' skin
                Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented
                Cemented in pain, juggling the pros and cons of fame
                I don't know how to make friends, I'm a lonely soul
                I recollect this isolation, I was four years old
                Truth be told, I've been battling my soul, tryna navigate the real and fake
                Cynical about the judgement day
                I did past life progression last year and it fucked me up
                Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus
                Body after body, lesson after lesson
                Let's take it back to Michigan in 1947
                My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn't listen to him
                I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doing
                Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on the grand level
                The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel
                And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin' for my place in the world
                With my guitar up on my hip, that's the story unfurled
                I found myself with a pocket full of money
                And a whole lot of respect, while the record vendors loved me
                I was head of rhythm and blues
                The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose
                But I manipulated power, as I lied to the masses
                Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated
                Another life had placed me as a black woman in a Chitlin' Circuit
                Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curatins
                My voice was angelic straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed
                A musical genius what the articles emphasized
                Had everything I wanted but I couldn't escape addiction
                Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted
                Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be
                Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity
                Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments
                I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin
                Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar
                Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody's lookin'
                My first assistant was a small-town scholar
                Never did a Quaalude 'til I got myself around her
                My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me
                I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated
                My present life is Kendrick Lamar
                A rapper looking at the lyrics to keep you in awe
                The only factor I respected was raising the bar
                My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
                My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
                I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
                Ego and pride had me looking at him with resentment
                I close my eyes hoping that I don't come off contentious
                I'm yelling, "Father, did I finally get it right?" Everything I did was selfless
                I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
                I didn't gloat, even told 'em, "No, " when the vultures came
                Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed
                "Son you do well but your heart is closed
                I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself"
                Father I'm not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down
                "But your pride has to die, " okay father show me how
                "Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for"
                I kept one hundred institutions paid, "Okay, tell me more"
                I put one hundred hoods on one stage, "Okay, tell me more"
                I'm tryna push peace in LA, "But you love war"
                No, I don't, "Oh, yes, you do, " okay then tell me the truth
                "Every individual is only a version of you
                How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?"
                I could tell You where I'm going, "I could tell you who you are"
                You fell out of heaven 'cause you was anxious
                Didn't like authority, only searched to be heinous
                Isaiah fourteen was the only thing that was prevalent
                My greatest music director was you
                It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
                It was harmony and motion
                I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
                Rehabilitation not psychosis
                But now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music
                Embodied you as superstars to see how you moving
                You came a long way from garnishing evil-ish views
                And all I ever wanted from You was love and approval
                I learned a lot, no more putting these people in fear
                The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
                The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
                I'm using words for inspiration as an ideal
                "So can you promise that you won't take your gifts for granted?"
                I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understanding
                "For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?"
                I vow my life just to live one in harmony now
                "You crushed a lot of people keeping their thoughts in captivity"
                And I'm ashamed that I ever created that enemy
                "Then let's rejoice where we at"
                I rewrote the devil's story just to take our power back, 'carnated

                All
                All
                'Cause my intentions was pure
                Even when you wasn't sure
                Even with every allure
                How much temptation you endured?
                You'd probably look for every cure
                I said I deserve it all
                I'm wakin' up at 6 a.m.
                Six miles a day, conditionin' my wind
                I said I deserve it all

                Seekin' validation just for the aesthetics
                Bitch, I deserve it all
                I see you as a human first
                Even when you didn't understand your worth

                Whisper to me every time I close my eyes
                He say, "You deserve it all"
                Keep these bitch niggas away from me
                Keep all my blessings faithfully
                Keep my essence contagious, that's okay with me

                I'm crashin' out right now, no one's safe with me
                I did it with integrity and niggas still try hate on me, just wait and see
                More blood be spillin', it's just paint to me
                Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me
                Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?
                How annoying, does it angers me to know the lames can speak
                On the origins of the game I breathe? That's insane to me
                It's important, I deserve it all because it's mine
                Tell me why you think you deserve the greatest of all time, motherfucker
